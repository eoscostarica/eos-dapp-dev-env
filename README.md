# EOS Local 

A docker compose based development environment for EOS DApp Development.   

This is easiest way maintain a local environment for development that is guaranteed to work out-of-the-box across the different host operating systems: Mac OS, Windows and Linux.  

**Important Disclaimer: This is a Work in Progress** 

EOS Local is a community-driven project lead by EOS Costa Rica. We welcome contributions of all sorts. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, proposing features, improving documentation, contributing code, design/ux proposals.

## Contributing

We use a Kanban-style board with built-in triggers to automatically move issues and pull requests across New Issues, To Do, In Progress and Done columns. That's were we prioritize the work. [Go to Project Board](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-local/projects/3).

The main communication channels for organizing and collaborating are [github issues](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-local/issues) and the [EOS Costa Rica Discord server](https://eoscostarica.io/discord). Feel to join and ask as many questions you may have.


We follow EOS Costa Rica's Open Source Contributing Guidelines. https://learn.eoscostarica.io/open-source/

Our weekly sync call is every Monday 7pm-8pm Costa Rica / Central Standard Time at [meet.eoscostarica.io](https:/meet.eoscostarica.io).

Please report bugs big and small by [opening an issue](https://github.com/eoscostarica/eos-local/issues)

## Features

- Fully virtualized EOS blockchain development environment.
- Fnteligent automated blockchain replay. ( no more replay flag shenanigans )
- Microservices architecture with docker compose with:
  - Nginx reverse proxy for virtual host resolution from the host machine.
  - Network specific service aliases for "virtual host" resolution within the containers.
- Out-of-box services: 
  - Postgres database.
  - Mongodb database.
  - Demux service.
  - Eos-dev node for contract dev and compilation.
  - Eos fullnode with history.
  - Graphql endpoint.
  - reactjs client with:
    - Scatter integration.
    - Lynx integration.
    - Eosaccount profile page.
    - Material UI.
    - GraphQL Apollo client.
- Handy scripts for interacting with the local EOS services.
- Gulp as global task manager.
- Automated code linting and testing.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment. ( Travis and Netlify )

## Getting started

Basic knowledge about Docker, Docker Compose, EOS and NodeJS is required to use this environment.

Please look at our [Getting Started With EOS]

**Global Dependencies**

- Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/.   
At least 7GB RAM (Docker -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Memory -> 7GB or above)
- Install node.js v8 ( carbon ) on your machine.  
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to [manage multiple node.js versions on your computer](https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/automatic-node.js-version-switching/).
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.

*Note: at the moment we are not using a docker container for running dapp due to issues related to reloading the app*

**Client Side Dependencies**

- `yarn`   install node packages

**Commands**

- `gulp setup` run chain initilization and database migrations.
- `gulp start` starts the docker containers with nodeos and keosd processes.
- `gulp stop` stops and removes all containers.
- `gulp restart` restarts all services.
- `gulp flush` remove all blockchain and database data.
- `gulp cleos` executes cleos on the virtualized environment against the eosiodev node. 

Eg:

```shell
➜  eos-dapp-dev-env git:(master) yarn cleos get info
yarn run v1.5.1
$ ./cleos.sh get info
{
  "server_version": "ad4ba283",
  "chain_id": "cf057bbfb72640471fd910bcb67639c22df9f92470936cddc1ade0e2f2e7dc4f",
