# EOS Dapp Development Environment

A docker compose based development environment for EOS DApp Development.   
This is easiest way maintain a local environment for development that is guaranteed to work out of the box across the different host operating systems: Mac OS, Windows and Linux.  

**Disclaimer: This is a Work in Progress**

## Features

- containerized EOS blockchain development environment.
- nginx reverse proxy for virtual host resolution from the host machine.
- network specific service aliases for "virtual host" resolution within the containers.
- handy scripts for interacting with the local EOS services.
- yarn as task manager

## Getting started

Basic knowledge about Docker, Docker Compose, EOS and NodeJS is required to use this environment.

**Global Dependencies**

- Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/.   
At least 7GB RAM (Docker -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Memory -> 7GB or above)
- Install node.js v8 ( carbon ) on your machine.  
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to [manage multiple your version on your computer](https://gaboesquivel.com/blog/2015/automatic-node.js-version-switching/).
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/.

*Note: at the moment we are not using a docker container for running dapp due to issues related to reloading the app*

**Client Side Dependencies**

- `yarn`

**Commands**

- `yarn eos-dev` starts the eos
- `yarn eos-dev:down` stops and removes the containers

**Known Issues**

- During first run, "eos-dapp-dev-env_nodeosd_1 exited with code 254" can be avoided by commenting the parameters --replay-blockchain --hard-replay-blockchain, on the nodeosd service in the docker-compose.yml file.

## TODO

- instructions for contract development
- improve docker compose commands documentation
- create more handy scripts
- create a sample dapp
- add recipe for configuring clion https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/docker.html
- `yarn start` starts the sample dapp
- seeding ?
